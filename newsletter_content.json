Sure, having all that knowledge at our fingertips is great \u2014 but the real trick is figuring out how to keep it all straight.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlphabet\u2019s tackling the problem with an experimental platform called [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) designed to be a study buddy, a productivity coach, a veteran librarian, and your favorite podcast host all wrapped into one. Think of it like a souped-up version of Docs that uses AI to help you make sense of videos, research, and meeting notes.\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s it for?\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* **Organizing: **Transform cluttered notes into different formats, including timelines, study guides, and FAQs\r\n\r\n* **Curating: **Pull out only the most relevant information from your notes so you don\u2019t waste time digging through unnecessary details\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s clearly a handy tool for students and academics, but it\u2019s also a great for professionals who want to manage projects and brainstorm ideas.\r\n\r\n**It just got a major overhaul: **Earlier this month, Alphabet introduced an \u201caudio overview\u201d feature that lets you instantly turn any document into a podcast featuring two AI-generated hosts. Now, you can do the same with videos and audio \u2014 then share it with colleagues or classmates via a link.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **By leveraging AI to organize, curate, and even vocalize information, NotebookLM could revolutionize how we learn and work \u2014 making complex data more accessible and actionable for everyone from students to professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY DIGITALOCEAN**\r\n\r\n## **Unlock AI\u2019s full potential with DigitalOcean GPUs**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5c984284-8844-4460-97c5-f080245f1460/digitalocean0927.jpg?t=1727364222)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product) provides **scalable, affordable GPU solutions** that are powerful _and_ user-friendly.\r\n\r\n* Ideal for deep learning, high-performance computing, analytics, and video rendering\r\n\r\n* **Powered by NVIDIA's H100 GPUs**\r\n\r\n* Scales to your business needs to keep costs to a minimum\r\n\r\n* Superb customer service for fast enactment\r\n\r\n**[Be one of the first to try DigitalOcean\u2019s GPU Droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product)****.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **THE AI ACADEMY **\r\n\r\n## How to create interactive data dashboards with Claude\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/b9389faf-92a0-4f2d-ba85-9790481201ff/Group_1000004059__1___1_.jpg?t=1727367367)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlUzali974)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nData dashboards are a great way to visualize and understand data.

[Here\u2019s how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlUzali974):\r\n\r\n1. Go to Claude\u2019s [website](https://claude.ai/new) and sign up. Make sure you select Claude 3.5 Sonnet as your model and turn on the artifact feature.\r\n\r\n2. Attach your CSV file and enter the prompt:\r\n\r\n\"Create an interactive dashboard from this data.\"\r\n\r\n3.

To do it, they first had to solve a calculus puzzle that has eluded mathematicians since 1907 \u2014 basically, an equation that explains how neurons communicate with each other via electrical signals.\r\n\r\nThey cracked that problem a few years ago, and this week, their startup, Liquid AI, announced it had used the algorithm to build a new AI platform \u2014 one that requires far less energy than traditional LLMs. The Boston-based firm just got $37.5M in seed funding, with backing from a Boston Celtics co-owner, plus execs at RedHat and Shopify.\r\n\r\n**How it works:\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* Models like GPT and Claude draw from massive, billion-parameter datasets to generate their answers\r\n\r\n* But their digital brains are already at max capacity, so if you feed them new information, they won\u2019t be able to remember it for long\r\n\r\n* On the other hand, Liquid\u2019s model only has a few dozen neurons, but it learns as it goes, piecing together new information alongside the things it already knows\r\n\r\n**Digging Deeper: **The model comes in three different sizes \u2014 1B, 3B, and 40B. They all show state-of-the-art performance and efficiency as well as lower hallucination rates, even while using a completely unique architecture.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **As the name suggests, it\u2019s designed to be more flexible and adaptable \u2014 leading to AI systems that can quickly learn new tasks. Imagine a self-driving car that gets smarter with every mile, continuously refining its skills on the road. Plus, it\u2019s much greener, since less computing power means a smaller carbon footprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **SPONSORED BY MASTERWORKS**\r\n\r\n## **OpenAI = S&P 500?

In just a few years, HuggingFace has become that toolbox for the AI industry. It\u2019s the go-to place to host your own LLM or borrow ideas from fellow coders \u2014 and it just earned the distinction of being [home](https://x.com/ClementDelangue/status/1839375655688884305) to 1 million models.\r\n\r\n**How it happened: **When it launched in 2016, HuggingFace aimed to build a chatbot geared toward teenagers. But soon, the company realized there was a much bigger opportunity hiding right under its nose. It pivoted to building an AI library that anyone can contribute to, democratizing access to the most powerful open-source models. \r\n\r\n**How it became so popular: **\r\n\r\n* HuggingFace started out as a place for niche developers\r\n\r\n* But it\u2019s steadily brought more people into the fold with an easy-to-use interface, tutorials, and forums\r\n\r\n* From hobbyist developers to tech giants, HuggingFace says everyone is represented in its growing digital neighborhood \u2014 even beginners who don\u2019t have a lot of coding experience\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s inside the library? **The headline-grabbing models like Llama, Mistral, Flux, and Grok are all there, but so are thousands of specialty ones geared toward real-world applications like audio classification, image generation, and everything in between.\r\n\r\n**Why it\u2019s important: **The future of AI isn\u2019t just about creating powerful models, but about making them available and understandable to all who want to use and improve them. That collaborative approach has been so successful that open models \u2014 most recently, the Allen Institute for AI\u2019s fully multimodal Molmo \u2014 can now go toe-to-toe with the likes of GPT-4o and Claude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **A MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSORS**\r\n\r\n## **Only days left: Learn how to scale your startup\u2019s AI potential**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0651c6bf-b5cd-4b2e-a9c3-06abce0f120b/google0930.jpg?t=1727447052)\r\nFollow image link: (https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nWant to enhance your startup with the latest AI solutions, but not sure how?\r\n\r\nAt the [Cloud Startup Summit](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24) on October 8, industry experts and top venture capitalists will teach you\u2026\r\n\r\n* **How to harness AI breakthroughs in your business**\r\n\r\n* Venture capital and funding trends\r\n\r\n* How other startups are disrupting with AI\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll also have time to network with VCs and founders and explore more support options for your startup.\r\n\r\n**[RSVP for the October 8 summit here](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)****.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **THE AI ACADEMY **\r\n\r\n## **Virtually try on clothes with HuggingFace**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/80338764-2667-44cd-a2fd-68838b567f06/Group_1000004121.jpg?t=1727453125)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nYou can try on clothes virtually with HuggingFace's Kolors Virtual Try-On tool.

The chip designer went on an acquisition [frenzy](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-acquires-octoai-2024-9) this year, gobbling up five companies so far. Its latest purchase: OctoAI, a five-year-old startup that helps companies tweak their hardware so it's more customizable. It reportedly paid around $165M for the Seattle-based company.\r\n\r\n**What does Nvidia get out of it? **The world\u2019s third-largest company creates the most powerful AI chips around, but they\u2019re only compatible with Nvidia\u2019s own hardware, making them less friendly to industry newcomers. OctoAI\u2019s software acts as a translator, helping Nvidia chips work with any type of infrastructure \u2014 a move that\u2019s more accessible for smaller developers.\r\n\r\nIn general, the string of purchases shows that Nvidia wants to expand its horizons beyond GPUs. It makes sense from a talent perspective, too: Bringing on a team of highly skilled developers is much easier than recruiting each member individually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY INNOVATING WITH AI**\r\n\r\n## Want to become an AI Consultant?\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/655956dc-3643-4084-9281-08bb970dd0a4/IWAI_Consultancy_E.jpg?t=1727447115)\r\nFollow image link: (https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nInnovating with AI just welcomed 200 new students into [The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman), their new program that trains you to build a business as an AI consultant:\r\n\r\n* Tools, frameworks, and a 6-month plan to build a 6-figure AI consulting business\r\n\r\n**[Click here to request early access to The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **AI & TECH NEWS**\r\n\r\n## Everything else you need to know today\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/66890527-b9f6-4573-bad0-db517cad3f9c/1727277123660.jpg?t=1727460344)\r\nCaption: Source: Meta\r\n\r\n* **Uncanny Update:** Meta users may soon notice personalized, AI-generated posts appearing on their timelines, including images that feature their own likeness.\r\n\r\n* **Stay the Course: **OpenAI\u2019s CFO reportedly told employees the startup is moving forward with plans to close a funding round next week, despite a series of high-profile resignations.\r\n\r\n* **Per My Last Email: **Gemini\u2019s smart replies feature can now analyze full email threads in order to generate responses that \u201cfully capture the intent of your message.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udde0 **Brain Food: **According to a new Cambridge study, AI might have CEOs beat when it comes to things like market optimization and product design.

To do it, they first had to solve a calculus puzzle that has eluded mathematicians since 1907 \u2014 basically, an equation that explains how neurons communicate with each other via electrical signals.\r\n\r\nThey cracked that problem a few years ago, and this week, their startup, Liquid AI, announced it had used the algorithm to build a new AI platform \u2014 one that requires far less energy than traditional LLMs. The Boston-based firm just got $37.5M in seed funding, with backing from a Boston Celtics co-owner, plus execs at RedHat and Shopify.\r\n\r\n**How it works:\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* Models like GPT and Claude draw from massive, billion-parameter datasets to generate their answers\r\n\r\n* But their digital brains are already at max capacity, so if you feed them new information, they won\u2019t be able to remember it for long\r\n\r\n* On the other hand, Liquid\u2019s model only has a few dozen neurons, but it learns as it goes, piecing together new information alongside the things it already knows\r\n\r\n**Digging Deeper: **The model comes in three different sizes \u2014 1B, 3B, and 40B. They all show state-of-the-art performance and efficiency as well as lower hallucination rates, even while using a completely unique architecture.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **As the name suggests, it\u2019s designed to be more flexible and adaptable \u2014 leading to AI systems that can quickly learn new tasks. Imagine a self-driving car that gets smarter with every mile, continuously refining its skills on the road. Plus, it\u2019s much greener, since less computing power means a smaller carbon footprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **SPONSORED BY MASTERWORKS**\r\n\r\n## **OpenAI = S&P 500?

It shot to new heights with the reasoning-focused o1 and the long-awaited Advanced Voice mode. Then, news that it was adopting a for-profit model \u2014 and that three execs were headed for the door \u2014 sent it crashing back down to earth.\r\n\r\nBut the Sam Altman-led startup just found a [new ladder](https://openai.com/index/scale-the-benefits-of-ai/) right back to the top with a $6.6B funding round that values the company at $157B \u2014 the largest VC deal ever recorded. **Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the historic milestone:**\r\n\r\n* The investment firm Thrive Capital led the round; Microsoft and Nvidia joined in as well \u2014 but Apple was notably absent\r\n\r\n* In an unusual move, the funders promised not to back OpenAI\u2019s biggest rivals, including Anthropic and xAI\r\n\r\n* The company has grown to around 1,700 employees \u2014 up from 700 at the start of 2024\r\n\r\n* Despite some internal chaos, just 6% of employees have left for other firms, according to [Sherwood News](https://sherwood.news/tech/openais-leadership-is-in-upheaval-but-overall-turnover-is-shockingly-low/)\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **Investors are putting a lot of faith in the ChatGPT-maker. It\u2019s now valued at around 40 times its revenue, a ratio way above the norm. Sure, they think it has plenty of room to grow, but the move also signals their confidence that OpenAI is the company best positioned to reach AGI.\r\n\r\n**What will OpenAI do with the funds? **In all likelihood, it\u2019s already deep into building GPT-5.

[Here\u2019s how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlUzali974):\r\n\r\n1. Go to Claude\u2019s [website](https://claude.ai/new) and sign up.

Attach your CSV file and enter the prompt:\r\n\r\n\"Create an interactive dashboard from this data.\"\r\n\r\n3.

In just a few years, HuggingFace has become that toolbox for the AI industry. It\u2019s the go-to place to host your own LLM or borrow ideas from fellow coders \u2014 and it just earned the distinction of being [home](https://x.com/ClementDelangue/status/1839375655688884305) to 1 million models.\r\n\r\n**How it happened: **When it launched in 2016, HuggingFace aimed to build a chatbot geared toward teenagers. But soon, the company realized there was a much bigger opportunity hiding right under its nose. It pivoted to building an AI library that anyone can contribute to, democratizing access to the most powerful open-source models. \r\n\r\n**How it became so popular: **\r\n\r\n* HuggingFace started out as a place for niche developers\r\n\r\n* But it\u2019s steadily brought more people into the fold with an easy-to-use interface, tutorials, and forums\r\n\r\n* From hobbyist developers to tech giants, HuggingFace says everyone is represented in its growing digital neighborhood \u2014 even beginners who don\u2019t have a lot of coding experience\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s inside the library? **The headline-grabbing models like Llama, Mistral, Flux, and Grok are all there, but so are thousands of specialty ones geared toward real-world applications like audio classification, image generation, and everything in between.\r\n\r\n**Why it\u2019s important: **The future of AI isn\u2019t just about creating powerful models, but about making them available and understandable to all who want to use and improve them. That collaborative approach has been so successful that open models \u2014 most recently, the Allen Institute for AI\u2019s fully multimodal Molmo \u2014 can now go toe-to-toe with the likes of GPT-4o and Claude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **A MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSORS**\r\n\r\n## **Only days left: Learn how to scale your startup\u2019s AI potential**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0651c6bf-b5cd-4b2e-a9c3-06abce0f120b/google0930.jpg?t=1727447052)\r\nFollow image link: (https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nWant to enhance your startup with the latest AI solutions, but not sure how?\r\n\r\nAt the [Cloud Startup Summit](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24) on October 8, industry experts and top venture capitalists will teach you\u2026\r\n\r\n* **How to harness AI breakthroughs in your business**\r\n\r\n* Venture capital and funding trends\r\n\r\n* How other startups are disrupting with AI\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll also have time to network with VCs and founders and explore more support options for your startup.\r\n\r\n**[RSVP for the October 8 summit here](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)****.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **THE AI ACADEMY **\r\n\r\n## **Virtually try on clothes with HuggingFace**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/80338764-2667-44cd-a2fd-68838b567f06/Group_1000004121.jpg?t=1727453125)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nYou can try on clothes virtually with HuggingFace's Kolors Virtual Try-On tool.

The chip designer went on an acquisition [frenzy](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-acquires-octoai-2024-9) this year, gobbling up five companies so far. Its latest purchase: OctoAI, a five-year-old startup that helps companies tweak their hardware so it's more customizable. It reportedly paid around $165M for the Seattle-based company.\r\n\r\n**What does Nvidia get out of it? **The world\u2019s third-largest company creates the most powerful AI chips around, but they\u2019re only compatible with Nvidia\u2019s own hardware, making them less friendly to industry newcomers. OctoAI\u2019s software acts as a translator, helping Nvidia chips work with any type of infrastructure \u2014 a move that\u2019s more accessible for smaller developers.\r\n\r\nIn general, the string of purchases shows that Nvidia wants to expand its horizons beyond GPUs. It makes sense from a talent perspective, too: Bringing on a team of highly skilled developers is much easier than recruiting each member individually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY INNOVATING WITH AI**\r\n\r\n## Want to become an AI Consultant?\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/655956dc-3643-4084-9281-08bb970dd0a4/IWAI_Consultancy_E.jpg?t=1727447115)\r\nFollow image link: (https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nInnovating with AI just welcomed 200 new students into [The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman), their new program that trains you to build a business as an AI consultant:\r\n\r\n* Tools, frameworks, and a 6-month plan to build a 6-figure AI consulting business\r\n\r\n**[Click here to request early access to The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **AI & TECH NEWS**\r\n\r\n## Everything else you need to know today\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/66890527-b9f6-4573-bad0-db517cad3f9c/1727277123660.jpg?t=1727460344)\r\nCaption: Source: Meta\r\n\r\n* **Uncanny Update:** Meta users may soon notice personalized, AI-generated posts appearing on their timelines, including images that feature their own likeness.\r\n\r\n* **Stay the Course: **OpenAI\u2019s CFO reportedly told employees the startup is moving forward with plans to close a funding round next week, despite a series of high-profile resignations.\r\n\r\n* **Per My Last Email: **Gemini\u2019s smart replies feature can now analyze full email threads in order to generate responses that \u201cfully capture the intent of your message.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udde0 **Brain Food: **According to a new Cambridge study, AI might have CEOs beat when it comes to things like market optimization and product design.

To do it, they first had to solve a calculus puzzle that has eluded mathematicians since 1907 \u2014 basically, an equation that explains how neurons communicate with each other via electrical signals.\r\n\r\nThey cracked that problem a few years ago, and this week, their startup, Liquid AI, announced it had used the algorithm to build a new AI platform \u2014 one that requires far less energy than traditional LLMs. The Boston-based firm just got $37.5M in seed funding, with backing from a Boston Celtics co-owner, plus execs at RedHat and Shopify.\r\n\r\n**How it works:\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* Models like GPT and Claude draw from massive, billion-parameter datasets to generate their answers\r\n\r\n* But their digital brains are already at max capacity, so if you feed them new information, they won\u2019t be able to remember it for long\r\n\r\n* On the other hand, Liquid\u2019s model only has a few dozen neurons, but it learns as it goes, piecing together new information alongside the things it already knows\r\n\r\n**Digging Deeper: **The model comes in three different sizes \u2014 1B, 3B, and 40B. They all show state-of-the-art performance and efficiency as well as lower hallucination rates, even while using a completely unique architecture.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **As the name suggests, it\u2019s designed to be more flexible and adaptable \u2014 leading to AI systems that can quickly learn new tasks. Imagine a self-driving car that gets smarter with every mile, continuously refining its skills on the road. Plus, it\u2019s much greener, since less computing power means a smaller carbon footprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **SPONSORED BY MASTERWORKS**\r\n\r\n## **OpenAI = S&P 500?

Then, news that it was adopting a for-profit model \u2014 and that three execs were headed for the door \u2014 sent it crashing back down to earth.\r\n\r\nBut the Sam Altman-led startup just found a [new ladder](https://openai.com/index/scale-the-benefits-of-ai/) right back to the top with a $6.6B funding round that values the company at $157B \u2014 the largest VC deal ever recorded. **Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the historic milestone:**\r\n\r\n* The investment firm Thrive Capital led the round; Microsoft and Nvidia joined in as well \u2014 but Apple was notably absent\r\n\r\n* In an unusual move, the funders promised not to back OpenAI\u2019s biggest rivals, including Anthropic and xAI\r\n\r\n* The company has grown to around 1,700 employees \u2014 up from 700 at the start of 2024\r\n\r\n* Despite some internal chaos, just 6% of employees have left for other firms, according to [Sherwood News](https://sherwood.news/tech/openais-leadership-is-in-upheaval-but-overall-turnover-is-shockingly-low/)\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **Investors are putting a lot of faith in the ChatGPT-maker. It\u2019s now valued at around 40 times its revenue, a ratio way above the norm. Sure, they think it has plenty of room to grow, but the move also signals their confidence that OpenAI is the company best positioned to reach AGI.\r\n\r\n**What will OpenAI do with the funds? **In all likelihood, it\u2019s already deep into building GPT-5. The funding boost will let OpenAI push on to the next level, including models that can interact with the real world, completing complex tasks for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY WEBAI**\r\n\r\n## One Platform.

Sure, having all that knowledge at our fingertips is great \u2014 but the real trick is figuring out how to keep it all straight.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlphabet\u2019s tackling the problem with an experimental platform called [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) designed to be a study buddy, a productivity coach, a veteran librarian, and your favorite podcast host all wrapped into one. Think of it like a souped-up version of Docs that uses AI to help you make sense of videos, research, and meeting notes.\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s it for?\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* **Organizing: **Transform cluttered notes into different formats, including timelines, study guides, and FAQs\r\n\r\n* **Curating: **Pull out only the most relevant information from your notes so you don\u2019t waste time digging through unnecessary details\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s clearly a handy tool for students and academics, but it\u2019s also a great for professionals who want to manage projects and brainstorm ideas.\r\n\r\n**It just got a major overhaul: **Earlier this month, Alphabet introduced an \u201caudio overview\u201d feature that lets you instantly turn any document into a podcast featuring two AI-generated hosts. Now, you can do the same with videos and audio \u2014 then share it with colleagues or classmates via a link.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **By leveraging AI to organize, curate, and even vocalize information, NotebookLM could revolutionize how we learn and work \u2014 making complex data more accessible and actionable for everyone from students to professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY DIGITALOCEAN**\r\n\r\n## **Unlock AI\u2019s full potential with DigitalOcean GPUs**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5c984284-8844-4460-97c5-f080245f1460/digitalocean0927.jpg?t=1727364222)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product) provides **scalable, affordable GPU solutions** that are powerful _and_ user-friendly.\r\n\r\n* Ideal for deep learning, high-performance computing, analytics, and video rendering\r\n\r\n* **Powered by NVIDIA's H100 GPUs**\r\n\r\n* Scales to your business needs to keep costs to a minimum\r\n\r\n* Superb customer service for fast enactment\r\n\r\n**[Be one of the first to try DigitalOcean\u2019s GPU Droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product)****.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **THE AI ACADEMY **\r\n\r\n## How to create interactive data dashboards with Claude\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/b9389faf-92a0-4f2d-ba85-9790481201ff/Group_1000004059__1___1_.jpg?t=1727367367)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlUzali974)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nData dashboards are a great way to visualize and understand data. However, building data dashboards can be time-consuming and require specialized skills. Fortunately, AI can help you create data dashboards without writing a single line of code. [Here\u2019s how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlUzali974):\r\n\r\n1. Go to Claude\u2019s [website](https://claude.ai/new) and sign up. Make sure you select Claude 3.5 Sonnet as your model and turn on the artifact feature.\r\n\r\n2. Attach your CSV file and enter the prompt:\r\n\r\n\"Create an interactive dashboard from this data.\"\r\n\r\n3. Wait for Claude to process your data and generate the dashboard.\r\n\r\n**Pro tips:**\r\n\r\n* You can customize your dashboard by adding or removing charts, changing the colors, and adding filters.\r\n\r\n* You can also export your dashboard as an image or HTML file. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **FROM THE FRONTIER**\r\n\r\n## **What\u2019s next for OpenAI?**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ab854f30-2feb-4841-92e7-163b25556219/download__4___1_.jpg?t=1727381896)\r\nCaption: Source: AP.

In just a few years, HuggingFace has become that toolbox for the AI industry. It\u2019s the go-to place to host your own LLM or borrow ideas from fellow coders \u2014 and it just earned the distinction of being [home](https://x.com/ClementDelangue/status/1839375655688884305) to 1 million models.\r\n\r\n**How it happened: **When it launched in 2016, HuggingFace aimed to build a chatbot geared toward teenagers. But soon, the company realized there was a much bigger opportunity hiding right under its nose. It pivoted to building an AI library that anyone can contribute to, democratizing access to the most powerful open-source models. \r\n\r\n**How it became so popular: **\r\n\r\n* HuggingFace started out as a place for niche developers\r\n\r\n* But it\u2019s steadily brought more people into the fold with an easy-to-use interface, tutorials, and forums\r\n\r\n* From hobbyist developers to tech giants, HuggingFace says everyone is represented in its growing digital neighborhood \u2014 even beginners who don\u2019t have a lot of coding experience\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s inside the library? **The headline-grabbing models like Llama, Mistral, Flux, and Grok are all there, but so are thousands of specialty ones geared toward real-world applications like audio classification, image generation, and everything in between.\r\n\r\n**Why it\u2019s important: **The future of AI isn\u2019t just about creating powerful models, but about making them available and understandable to all who want to use and improve them. That collaborative approach has been so successful that open models \u2014 most recently, the Allen Institute for AI\u2019s fully multimodal Molmo \u2014 can now go toe-to-toe with the likes of GPT-4o and Claude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **A MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSORS**\r\n\r\n## **Only days left: Learn how to scale your startup\u2019s AI potential**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0651c6bf-b5cd-4b2e-a9c3-06abce0f120b/google0930.jpg?t=1727447052)\r\nFollow image link: (https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nWant to enhance your startup with the latest AI solutions, but not sure how?\r\n\r\nAt the [Cloud Startup Summit](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24) on October 8, industry experts and top venture capitalists will teach you\u2026\r\n\r\n* **How to harness AI breakthroughs in your business**\r\n\r\n* Venture capital and funding trends\r\n\r\n* How other startups are disrupting with AI\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll also have time to network with VCs and founders and explore more support options for your startup.\r\n\r\n**[RSVP for the October 8 summit here](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)****.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **THE AI ACADEMY **\r\n\r\n## **Virtually try on clothes with HuggingFace**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/80338764-2667-44cd-a2fd-68838b567f06/Group_1000004121.jpg?t=1727453125)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nYou can try on clothes virtually with HuggingFace's Kolors Virtual Try-On tool.

The chip designer went on an acquisition [frenzy](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-acquires-octoai-2024-9) this year, gobbling up five companies so far. Its latest purchase: OctoAI, a five-year-old startup that helps companies tweak their hardware so it's more customizable. It reportedly paid around $165M for the Seattle-based company.\r\n\r\n**What does Nvidia get out of it? **The world\u2019s third-largest company creates the most powerful AI chips around, but they\u2019re only compatible with Nvidia\u2019s own hardware, making them less friendly to industry newcomers. OctoAI\u2019s software acts as a translator, helping Nvidia chips work with any type of infrastructure \u2014 a move that\u2019s more accessible for smaller developers.\r\n\r\nIn general, the string of purchases shows that Nvidia wants to expand its horizons beyond GPUs. It makes sense from a talent perspective, too: Bringing on a team of highly skilled developers is much easier than recruiting each member individually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY INNOVATING WITH AI**\r\n\r\n## Want to become an AI Consultant?\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/655956dc-3643-4084-9281-08bb970dd0a4/IWAI_Consultancy_E.jpg?t=1727447115)\r\nFollow image link: (https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nInnovating with AI just welcomed 200 new students into [The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman), their new program that trains you to build a business as an AI consultant:\r\n\r\n* Tools, frameworks, and a 6-month plan to build a 6-figure AI consulting business\r\n\r\n**[Click here to request early access to The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **AI & TECH NEWS**\r\n\r\n## Everything else you need to know today\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/66890527-b9f6-4573-bad0-db517cad3f9c/1727277123660.jpg?t=1727460344)\r\nCaption: Source: Meta\r\n\r\n* **Uncanny Update:** Meta users may soon notice personalized, AI-generated posts appearing on their timelines, including images that feature their own likeness.\r\n\r\n* **Stay the Course: **OpenAI\u2019s CFO reportedly told employees the startup is moving forward with plans to close a funding round next week, despite a series of high-profile resignations.\r\n\r\n* **Per My Last Email: **Gemini\u2019s smart replies feature can now analyze full email threads in order to generate responses that \u201cfully capture the intent of your message.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udde0 **Brain Food: **According to a new Cambridge study, AI might have CEOs beat when it comes to things like market optimization and product design.

To do it, they first had to solve a calculus puzzle that has eluded mathematicians since 1907 \u2014 basically, an equation that explains how neurons communicate with each other via electrical signals.\r\n\r\nThey cracked that problem a few years ago, and this week, their startup, Liquid AI, announced it had used the algorithm to build a new AI platform \u2014 one that requires far less energy than traditional LLMs. The Boston-based firm just got $37.5M in seed funding, with backing from a Boston Celtics co-owner, plus execs at RedHat and Shopify.\r\n\r\n**How it works:\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* Models like GPT and Claude draw from massive, billion-parameter datasets to generate their answers\r\n\r\n* But their digital brains are already at max capacity, so if you feed them new information, they won\u2019t be able to remember it for long\r\n\r\n* On the other hand, Liquid\u2019s model only has a few dozen neurons, but it learns as it goes, piecing together new information alongside the things it already knows\r\n\r\n**Digging Deeper: **The model comes in three different sizes \u2014 1B, 3B, and 40B. They all show state-of-the-art performance and efficiency as well as lower hallucination rates, even while using a completely unique architecture.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **As the name suggests, it\u2019s designed to be more flexible and adaptable \u2014 leading to AI systems that can quickly learn new tasks. Imagine a self-driving car that gets smarter with every mile, continuously refining its skills on the road. Plus, it\u2019s much greener, since less computing power means a smaller carbon footprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **SPONSORED BY MASTERWORKS**\r\n\r\n## **OpenAI = S&P 500?

But at a preview event Tuesday, Microsoft\u2019s Mustafa Suleyman said he thinks AI will make our devices more malleable, like clay that can be shaped and molded. With that in mind, Microsoft just unveiled a set of brand-new Copilot features. Here\u2019s everything we saw at Tuesday\u2019s sneak peek.\r\n\r\n**Copilot Voice: **An answer to OpenAI\u2019s Advanced Voice mode with a special focus on emotional intelligence. Its four voices can match your mood, make self-deprecating jokes, and reassure you if you\u2019re having a rough day.\r\n\r\n**Copilot Vision: **This feature can see everything on your screen and react accordingly. In one demo, a user asked about movies on Rotten Tomatoes. Copilot told him which ones were available to stream, offered review summaries, and gave custom recommendations.\r\n\r\n**Recall: **A super-powered browsing history that can help you find long-lost webpages and documents (i.e. \u201cFind the chart with the purple arrow from last week\u201d). It now includes biometric safety features and encryption.\r\n\r\n**What else?**\r\n\r\n* **Think Deeper**, powered by a fine-tuned version of o1, will help with complex decisions, like planning a family vacation\r\n\r\n* **Copilot Daily** is an AI-generated daily podcast with news stories tailored to you\r\n\r\n* **Paint** will automatically turn your scribbles into detailed works of art\r\n\r\n* **AI Search** helps you intuitively find settings, files, images, and more\r\n\r\n**Next up**, Suleyman wants to give Copilot a higher \u201caction quotient\u201d \u2014 or the ability to proactively reach out to you and make calls or purchases on your behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY AE STUDIO**\r\n\r\n## From idea to million-user experience\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/8dd5375c-7e00-42f8-b94d-35f99cb99bbe/aestudio1002.jpg?t=1727793390)\r\nFollow image link: (https://ae.studio/?utm_campaign=superhuman-100224&utm_source=superhuman&utm_medium=newsletter)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**Millions of users**, one live event, and an app that just... works.\r\n\r\nThat's what AE Studio pulled off for Eurovision Latinoam\u00e9rica.

It shot to new heights with the reasoning-focused o1 and the long-awaited Advanced Voice mode.

It\u2019s now valued at around 40 times its revenue, a ratio way above the norm. Sure, they think it has plenty of room to grow, but the move also signals their confidence that OpenAI is the company best positioned to reach AGI.\r\n\r\n**What will OpenAI do with the funds? **In all likelihood, it\u2019s already deep into building GPT-5.

Sure, having all that knowledge at our fingertips is great \u2014 but the real trick is figuring out how to keep it all straight.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlphabet\u2019s tackling the problem with an experimental platform called [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) designed to be a study buddy, a productivity coach, a veteran librarian, and your favorite podcast host all wrapped into one. Think of it like a souped-up version of Docs that uses AI to help you make sense of videos, research, and meeting notes.\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s it for?\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* **Organizing: **Transform cluttered notes into different formats, including timelines, study guides, and FAQs\r\n\r\n* **Curating: **Pull out only the most relevant information from your notes so you don\u2019t waste time digging through unnecessary details\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s clearly a handy tool for students and academics, but it\u2019s also a great for professionals who want to manage projects and brainstorm ideas.\r\n\r\n**It just got a major overhaul: **Earlier this month, Alphabet introduced an \u201caudio overview\u201d feature that lets you instantly turn any document into a podcast featuring two AI-generated hosts. Now, you can do the same with videos and audio \u2014 then share it with colleagues or classmates via a link.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **By leveraging AI to organize, curate, and even vocalize information, NotebookLM could revolutionize how we learn and work \u2014 making complex data more accessible and actionable for everyone from students to professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY DIGITALOCEAN**\r\n\r\n## **Unlock AI\u2019s full potential with DigitalOcean GPUs**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5c984284-8844-4460-97c5-f080245f1460/digitalocean0927.jpg?t=1727364222)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product) provides **scalable, affordable GPU solutions** that are powerful _and_ user-friendly.\r\n\r\n* Ideal for deep learning, high-performance computing, analytics, and video rendering\r\n\r\n* **Powered by NVIDIA's H100 GPUs**\r\n\r\n* Scales to your business needs to keep costs to a minimum\r\n\r\n* Superb customer service for fast enactment\r\n\r\n**[Be one of the first to try DigitalOcean\u2019s GPU Droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product)****.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **THE AI ACADEMY **\r\n\r\n## How to create interactive data dashboards with Claude\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/b9389faf-92a0-4f2d-ba85-9790481201ff/Group_1000004059__1___1_.jpg?t=1727367367)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlUzali974)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nData dashboards are a great way to visualize and understand data.

[Here\u2019s how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlUzali974):\r\n\r\n1. Go to Claude\u2019s [website](https://claude.ai/new) and sign up. Make sure you select Claude 3.5 Sonnet as your model and turn on the artifact feature.\r\n\r\n2. Attach your CSV file and enter the prompt:\r\n\r\n\"Create an interactive dashboard from this data.\"\r\n\r\n3. Wait for Claude to process your data and generate the dashboard.\r\n\r\n**Pro tips:**\r\n\r\n* You can customize your dashboard by adding or removing charts, changing the colors, and adding filters.\r\n\r\n* You can also export your dashboard as an image or HTML file. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **FROM THE FRONTIER**\r\n\r\n## **What\u2019s next for OpenAI?**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ab854f30-2feb-4841-92e7-163b25556219/download__4___1_.jpg?t=1727381896)\r\nCaption: Source: AP.

To do it, they first had to solve a calculus puzzle that has eluded mathematicians since 1907 \u2014 basically, an equation that explains how neurons communicate with each other via electrical signals.\r\n\r\nThey cracked that problem a few years ago, and this week, their startup, Liquid AI, announced it had used the algorithm to build a new AI platform \u2014 one that requires far less energy than traditional LLMs. The Boston-based firm just got $37.5M in seed funding, with backing from a Boston Celtics co-owner, plus execs at RedHat and Shopify.\r\n\r\n**How it works:\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* Models like GPT and Claude draw from massive, billion-parameter datasets to generate their answers\r\n\r\n* But their digital brains are already at max capacity, so if you feed them new information, they won\u2019t be able to remember it for long\r\n\r\n* On the other hand, Liquid\u2019s model only has a few dozen neurons, but it learns as it goes, piecing together new information alongside the things it already knows\r\n\r\n**Digging Deeper: **The model comes in three different sizes \u2014 1B, 3B, and 40B. They all show state-of-the-art performance and efficiency as well as lower hallucination rates, even while using a completely unique architecture.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **As the name suggests, it\u2019s designed to be more flexible and adaptable \u2014 leading to AI systems that can quickly learn new tasks. Imagine a self-driving car that gets smarter with every mile, continuously refining its skills on the road. Plus, it\u2019s much greener, since less computing power means a smaller carbon footprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **SPONSORED BY MASTERWORKS**\r\n\r\n## **OpenAI = S&P 500?

It shot to new heights with the reasoning-focused o1 and the long-awaited Advanced Voice mode.

It\u2019s now valued at around 40 times its revenue, a ratio way above the norm. Sure, they think it has plenty of room to grow, but the move also signals their confidence that OpenAI is the company best positioned to reach AGI.\r\n\r\n**What will OpenAI do with the funds? **In all likelihood, it\u2019s already deep into building GPT-5.

In just a few years, HuggingFace has become that toolbox for the AI industry. It\u2019s the go-to place to host your own LLM or borrow ideas from fellow coders \u2014 and it just earned the distinction of being [home](https://x.com/ClementDelangue/status/1839375655688884305) to 1 million models.\r\n\r\n**How it happened: **When it launched in 2016, HuggingFace aimed to build a chatbot geared toward teenagers. But soon, the company realized there was a much bigger opportunity hiding right under its nose. It pivoted to building an AI library that anyone can contribute to, democratizing access to the most powerful open-source models. \r\n\r\n**How it became so popular: **\r\n\r\n* HuggingFace started out as a place for niche developers\r\n\r\n* But it\u2019s steadily brought more people into the fold with an easy-to-use interface, tutorials, and forums\r\n\r\n* From hobbyist developers to tech giants, HuggingFace says everyone is represented in its growing digital neighborhood \u2014 even beginners who don\u2019t have a lot of coding experience\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s inside the library? **The headline-grabbing models like Llama, Mistral, Flux, and Grok are all there, but so are thousands of specialty ones geared toward real-world applications like audio classification, image generation, and everything in between.\r\n\r\n**Why it\u2019s important: **The future of AI isn\u2019t just about creating powerful models, but about making them available and understandable to all who want to use and improve them. That collaborative approach has been so successful that open models \u2014 most recently, the Allen Institute for AI\u2019s fully multimodal Molmo \u2014 can now go toe-to-toe with the likes of GPT-4o and Claude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **A MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSORS**\r\n\r\n## **Only days left: Learn how to scale your startup\u2019s AI potential**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0651c6bf-b5cd-4b2e-a9c3-06abce0f120b/google0930.jpg?t=1727447052)\r\nFollow image link: (https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nWant to enhance your startup with the latest AI solutions, but not sure how?\r\n\r\nAt the [Cloud Startup Summit](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24) on October 8, industry experts and top venture capitalists will teach you\u2026\r\n\r\n* **How to harness AI breakthroughs in your business**\r\n\r\n* Venture capital and funding trends\r\n\r\n* How other startups are disrupting with AI\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll also have time to network with VCs and founders and explore more support options for your startup.\r\n\r\n**[RSVP for the October 8 summit here](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)****.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **THE AI ACADEMY **\r\n\r\n## **Virtually try on clothes with HuggingFace**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/80338764-2667-44cd-a2fd-68838b567f06/Group_1000004121.jpg?t=1727453125)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nYou can try on clothes virtually with HuggingFace's Kolors Virtual Try-On tool.

The chip designer went on an acquisition [frenzy](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-acquires-octoai-2024-9) this year, gobbling up five companies so far. Its latest purchase: OctoAI, a five-year-old startup that helps companies tweak their hardware so it's more customizable. It reportedly paid around $165M for the Seattle-based company.\r\n\r\n**What does Nvidia get out of it? **The world\u2019s third-largest company creates the most powerful AI chips around, but they\u2019re only compatible with Nvidia\u2019s own hardware, making them less friendly to industry newcomers. OctoAI\u2019s software acts as a translator, helping Nvidia chips work with any type of infrastructure \u2014 a move that\u2019s more accessible for smaller developers.\r\n\r\nIn general, the string of purchases shows that Nvidia wants to expand its horizons beyond GPUs. It makes sense from a talent perspective, too: Bringing on a team of highly skilled developers is much easier than recruiting each member individually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY INNOVATING WITH AI**\r\n\r\n## Want to become an AI Consultant?\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/655956dc-3643-4084-9281-08bb970dd0a4/IWAI_Consultancy_E.jpg?t=1727447115)\r\nFollow image link: (https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nInnovating with AI just welcomed 200 new students into [The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman), their new program that trains you to build a business as an AI consultant:\r\n\r\n* Tools, frameworks, and a 6-month plan to build a 6-figure AI consulting business\r\n\r\n**[Click here to request early access to The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **AI & TECH NEWS**\r\n\r\n## Everything else you need to know today\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/66890527-b9f6-4573-bad0-db517cad3f9c/1727277123660.jpg?t=1727460344)\r\nCaption: Source: Meta\r\n\r\n* **Uncanny Update:** Meta users may soon notice personalized, AI-generated posts appearing on their timelines, including images that feature their own likeness.\r\n\r\n* **Stay the Course: **OpenAI\u2019s CFO reportedly told employees the startup is moving forward with plans to close a funding round next week, despite a series of high-profile resignations.\r\n\r\n* **Per My Last Email: **Gemini\u2019s smart replies feature can now analyze full email threads in order to generate responses that \u201cfully capture the intent of your message.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udde0 **Brain Food: **According to a new Cambridge study, AI might have CEOs beat when it comes to things like market optimization and product design.

To do it, they first had to solve a calculus puzzle that has eluded mathematicians since 1907 \u2014 basically, an equation that explains how neurons communicate with each other via electrical signals.\r\n\r\nThey cracked that problem a few years ago, and this week, their startup, Liquid AI, announced it had used the algorithm to build a new AI platform \u2014 one that requires far less energy than traditional LLMs. The Boston-based firm just got $37.5M in seed funding, with backing from a Boston Celtics co-owner, plus execs at RedHat and Shopify.\r\n\r\n**How it works:\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* Models like GPT and Claude draw from massive, billion-parameter datasets to generate their answers\r\n\r\n* But their digital brains are already at max capacity, so if you feed them new information, they won\u2019t be able to remember it for long\r\n\r\n* On the other hand, Liquid\u2019s model only has a few dozen neurons, but it learns as it goes, piecing together new information alongside the things it already knows\r\n\r\n**Digging Deeper: **The model comes in three different sizes \u2014 1B, 3B, and 40B. They all show state-of-the-art performance and efficiency as well as lower hallucination rates, even while using a completely unique architecture.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **As the name suggests, it\u2019s designed to be more flexible and adaptable \u2014 leading to AI systems that can quickly learn new tasks. Imagine a self-driving car that gets smarter with every mile, continuously refining its skills on the road. Plus, it\u2019s much greener, since less computing power means a smaller carbon footprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **SPONSORED BY MASTERWORKS**\r\n\r\n## **OpenAI = S&P 500?

Setup an Eleven Labs account\r\n\r\nEleven Labs has a suite of audio and speech features that you can use. All the features in this tutorial are available to try for free.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, you can create an mp3 file of a speaker reading out your content using the \u201ctext-to-speech\u201d tab.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/9551ad0f-66f3-4cfd-a629-bfdb28d505e2/image.png?t=1727950556)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n#### Step 2.

Sure, having all that knowledge at our fingertips is great \u2014 but the real trick is figuring out how to keep it all straight.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlphabet\u2019s tackling the problem with an experimental platform called [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) designed to be a study buddy, a productivity coach, a veteran librarian, and your favorite podcast host all wrapped into one.

However, building data dashboards can be time-consuming and require specialized skills. Fortunately, AI can help you create data dashboards without writing a single line of code. [Here\u2019s how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlUzali974):\r\n\r\n1. Go to Claude\u2019s [website](https://claude.ai/new) and sign up. Make sure you select Claude 3.5 Sonnet as your model and turn on the artifact feature.\r\n\r\n2. Attach your CSV file and enter the prompt:\r\n\r\n\"Create an interactive dashboard from this data.\"\r\n\r\n3. Wait for Claude to process your data and generate the dashboard.\r\n\r\n**Pro tips:**\r\n\r\n* You can customize your dashboard by adding or removing charts, changing the colors, and adding filters.\r\n\r\n* You can also export your dashboard as an image or HTML file. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **FROM THE FRONTIER**\r\n\r\n## **What\u2019s next for OpenAI?**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ab854f30-2feb-4841-92e7-163b25556219/download__4___1_.jpg?t=1727381896)\r\nCaption: Source: AP.

In just a few years, HuggingFace has become that toolbox for the AI industry.

But soon, the company realized there was a much bigger opportunity hiding right under its nose. It pivoted to building an AI library that anyone can contribute to, democratizing access to the most powerful open-source models. \r\n\r\n**How it became so popular: **\r\n\r\n* HuggingFace started out as a place for niche developers\r\n\r\n* But it\u2019s steadily brought more people into the fold with an easy-to-use interface, tutorials, and forums\r\n\r\n* From hobbyist developers to tech giants, HuggingFace says everyone is represented in its growing digital neighborhood \u2014 even beginners who don\u2019t have a lot of coding experience\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s inside the library? **The headline-grabbing models like Llama, Mistral, Flux, and Grok are all there, but so are thousands of specialty ones geared toward real-world applications like audio classification, image generation, and everything in between.\r\n\r\n**Why it\u2019s important: **The future of AI isn\u2019t just about creating powerful models, but about making them available and understandable to all who want to use and improve them. That collaborative approach has been so successful that open models \u2014 most recently, the Allen Institute for AI\u2019s fully multimodal Molmo \u2014 can now go toe-to-toe with the likes of GPT-4o and Claude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **A MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSORS**\r\n\r\n## **Only days left: Learn how to scale your startup\u2019s AI potential**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0651c6bf-b5cd-4b2e-a9c3-06abce0f120b/google0930.jpg?t=1727447052)\r\nFollow image link: (https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nWant to enhance your startup with the latest AI solutions, but not sure how?\r\n\r\nAt the [Cloud Startup Summit](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24) on October 8, industry experts and top venture capitalists will teach you\u2026\r\n\r\n* **How to harness AI breakthroughs in your business**\r\n\r\n* Venture capital and funding trends\r\n\r\n* How other startups are disrupting with AI\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll also have time to network with VCs and founders and explore more support options for your startup.\r\n\r\n**[RSVP for the October 8 summit here](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)****.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **THE AI ACADEMY **\r\n\r\n## **Virtually try on clothes with HuggingFace**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/80338764-2667-44cd-a2fd-68838b567f06/Group_1000004121.jpg?t=1727453125)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nYou can try on clothes virtually with HuggingFace's Kolors Virtual Try-On tool.

The chip designer went on an acquisition [frenzy](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-acquires-octoai-2024-9) this year, gobbling up five companies so far. Its latest purchase: OctoAI, a five-year-old startup that helps companies tweak their hardware so it's more customizable. It reportedly paid around $165M for the Seattle-based company.\r\n\r\n**What does Nvidia get out of it? **The world\u2019s third-largest company creates the most powerful AI chips around, but they\u2019re only compatible with Nvidia\u2019s own hardware, making them less friendly to industry newcomers. OctoAI\u2019s software acts as a translator, helping Nvidia chips work with any type of infrastructure \u2014 a move that\u2019s more accessible for smaller developers.\r\n\r\nIn general, the string of purchases shows that Nvidia wants to expand its horizons beyond GPUs. It makes sense from a talent perspective, too: Bringing on a team of highly skilled developers is much easier than recruiting each member individually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY INNOVATING WITH AI**\r\n\r\n## Want to become an AI Consultant?\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/655956dc-3643-4084-9281-08bb970dd0a4/IWAI_Consultancy_E.jpg?t=1727447115)\r\nFollow image link: (https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nInnovating with AI just welcomed 200 new students into [The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman), their new program that trains you to build a business as an AI consultant:\r\n\r\n* Tools, frameworks, and a 6-month plan to build a 6-figure AI consulting business\r\n\r\n**[Click here to request early access to The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **AI & TECH NEWS**\r\n\r\n## Everything else you need to know today\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/66890527-b9f6-4573-bad0-db517cad3f9c/1727277123660.jpg?t=1727460344)\r\nCaption: Source: Meta\r\n\r\n* **Uncanny Update:** Meta users may soon notice personalized, AI-generated posts appearing on their timelines, including images that feature their own likeness.\r\n\r\n* **Stay the Course: **OpenAI\u2019s CFO reportedly told employees the startup is moving forward with plans to close a funding round next week, despite a series of high-profile resignations.\r\n\r\n* **Per My Last Email: **Gemini\u2019s smart replies feature can now analyze full email threads in order to generate responses that \u201cfully capture the intent of your message.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udde0 **Brain Food: **According to a new Cambridge study, AI might have CEOs beat when it comes to things like market optimization and product design.

To do it, they first had to solve a calculus puzzle that has eluded mathematicians since 1907 \u2014 basically, an equation that explains how neurons communicate with each other via electrical signals.\r\n\r\nThey cracked that problem a few years ago, and this week, their startup, Liquid AI, announced it had used the algorithm to build a new AI platform \u2014 one that requires far less energy than traditional LLMs. The Boston-based firm just got $37.5M in seed funding, with backing from a Boston Celtics co-owner, plus execs at RedHat and Shopify.\r\n\r\n**How it works:\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* Models like GPT and Claude draw from massive, billion-parameter datasets to generate their answers\r\n\r\n* But their digital brains are already at max capacity, so if you feed them new information, they won\u2019t be able to remember it for long\r\n\r\n* On the other hand, Liquid\u2019s model only has a few dozen neurons, but it learns as it goes, piecing together new information alongside the things it already knows\r\n\r\n**Digging Deeper: **The model comes in three different sizes \u2014 1B, 3B, and 40B. They all show state-of-the-art performance and efficiency as well as lower hallucination rates, even while using a completely unique architecture.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **As the name suggests, it\u2019s designed to be more flexible and adaptable \u2014 leading to AI systems that can quickly learn new tasks. Imagine a self-driving car that gets smarter with every mile, continuously refining its skills on the road. Plus, it\u2019s much greener, since less computing power means a smaller carbon footprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **SPONSORED BY MASTERWORKS**\r\n\r\n## **OpenAI = S&P 500?

It shot to new heights with the reasoning-focused o1 and the long-awaited Advanced Voice mode. Then, news that it was adopting a for-profit model \u2014 and that three execs were headed for the door \u2014 sent it crashing back down to earth.\r\n\r\nBut the Sam Altman-led startup just found a [new ladder](https://openai.com/index/scale-the-benefits-of-ai/) right back to the top with a $6.6B funding round that values the company at $157B \u2014 the largest VC deal ever recorded. **Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the historic milestone:**\r\n\r\n* The investment firm Thrive Capital led the round; Microsoft and Nvidia joined in as well \u2014 but Apple was notably absent\r\n\r\n* In an unusual move, the funders promised not to back OpenAI\u2019s biggest rivals, including Anthropic and xAI\r\n\r\n* The company has grown to around 1,700 employees \u2014 up from 700 at the start of 2024\r\n\r\n* Despite some internal chaos, just 6% of employees have left for other firms, according to [Sherwood News](https://sherwood.news/tech/openais-leadership-is-in-upheaval-but-overall-turnover-is-shockingly-low/)\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **Investors are putting a lot of faith in the ChatGPT-maker. It\u2019s now valued at around 40 times its revenue, a ratio way above the norm. Sure, they think it has plenty of room to grow, but the move also signals their confidence that OpenAI is the company best positioned to reach AGI.\r\n\r\n**What will OpenAI do with the funds? **In all likelihood, it\u2019s already deep into building GPT-5.

[Here\u2019s how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlUzali974):\r\n\r\n1. Go to Claude\u2019s [website](https://claude.ai/new) and sign up.

Attach your CSV file and enter the prompt:\r\n\r\n\"Create an interactive dashboard from this data.\"\r\n\r\n3.

In just a few years, HuggingFace has become that toolbox for the AI industry. It\u2019s the go-to place to host your own LLM or borrow ideas from fellow coders \u2014 and it just earned the distinction of being [home](https://x.com/ClementDelangue/status/1839375655688884305) to 1 million models.\r\n\r\n**How it happened: **When it launched in 2016, HuggingFace aimed to build a chatbot geared toward teenagers. But soon, the company realized there was a much bigger opportunity hiding right under its nose. It pivoted to building an AI library that anyone can contribute to, democratizing access to the most powerful open-source models. \r\n\r\n**How it became so popular: **\r\n\r\n* HuggingFace started out as a place for niche developers\r\n\r\n* But it\u2019s steadily brought more people into the fold with an easy-to-use interface, tutorials, and forums\r\n\r\n* From hobbyist developers to tech giants, HuggingFace says everyone is represented in its growing digital neighborhood \u2014 even beginners who don\u2019t have a lot of coding experience\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s inside the library? **The headline-grabbing models like Llama, Mistral, Flux, and Grok are all there, but so are thousands of specialty ones geared toward real-world applications like audio classification, image generation, and everything in between.\r\n\r\n**Why it\u2019s important: **The future of AI isn\u2019t just about creating powerful models, but about making them available and understandable to all who want to use and improve them. That collaborative approach has been so successful that open models \u2014 most recently, the Allen Institute for AI\u2019s fully multimodal Molmo \u2014 can now go toe-to-toe with the likes of GPT-4o and Claude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **A MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSORS**\r\n\r\n## **Only days left: Learn how to scale your startup\u2019s AI potential**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0651c6bf-b5cd-4b2e-a9c3-06abce0f120b/google0930.jpg?t=1727447052)\r\nFollow image link: (https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nWant to enhance your startup with the latest AI solutions, but not sure how?\r\n\r\nAt the [Cloud Startup Summit](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24) on October 8, industry experts and top venture capitalists will teach you\u2026\r\n\r\n* **How to harness AI breakthroughs in your business**\r\n\r\n* Venture capital and funding trends\r\n\r\n* How other startups are disrupting with AI\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll also have time to network with VCs and founders and explore more support options for your startup.\r\n\r\n**[RSVP for the October 8 summit here](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)****.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **THE AI ACADEMY **\r\n\r\n## **Virtually try on clothes with HuggingFace**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/80338764-2667-44cd-a2fd-68838b567f06/Group_1000004121.jpg?t=1727453125)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nYou can try on clothes virtually with HuggingFace's Kolors Virtual Try-On tool.

The chip designer went on an acquisition [frenzy](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-acquires-octoai-2024-9) this year, gobbling up five companies so far. Its latest purchase: OctoAI, a five-year-old startup that helps companies tweak their hardware so it's more customizable. It reportedly paid around $165M for the Seattle-based company.\r\n\r\n**What does Nvidia get out of it? **The world\u2019s third-largest company creates the most powerful AI chips around, but they\u2019re only compatible with Nvidia\u2019s own hardware, making them less friendly to industry newcomers. OctoAI\u2019s software acts as a translator, helping Nvidia chips work with any type of infrastructure \u2014 a move that\u2019s more accessible for smaller developers.\r\n\r\nIn general, the string of purchases shows that Nvidia wants to expand its horizons beyond GPUs. It makes sense from a talent perspective, too: Bringing on a team of highly skilled developers is much easier than recruiting each member individually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY INNOVATING WITH AI**\r\n\r\n## Want to become an AI Consultant?\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/655956dc-3643-4084-9281-08bb970dd0a4/IWAI_Consultancy_E.jpg?t=1727447115)\r\nFollow image link: (https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nInnovating with AI just welcomed 200 new students into [The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman), their new program that trains you to build a business as an AI consultant:\r\n\r\n* Tools, frameworks, and a 6-month plan to build a 6-figure AI consulting business\r\n\r\n**[Click here to request early access to The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **AI & TECH NEWS**\r\n\r\n## Everything else you need to know today\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/66890527-b9f6-4573-bad0-db517cad3f9c/1727277123660.jpg?t=1727460344)\r\nCaption: Source: Meta\r\n\r\n* **Uncanny Update:** Meta users may soon notice personalized, AI-generated posts appearing on their timelines, including images that feature their own likeness.\r\n\r\n* **Stay the Course: **OpenAI\u2019s CFO reportedly told employees the startup is moving forward with plans to close a funding round next week, despite a series of high-profile resignations.\r\n\r\n* **Per My Last Email: **Gemini\u2019s smart replies feature can now analyze full email threads in order to generate responses that \u201cfully capture the intent of your message.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udde0 **Brain Food: **According to a new Cambridge study, AI might have CEOs beat when it comes to things like market optimization and product design.

To do it, they first had to solve a calculus puzzle that has eluded mathematicians since 1907 \u2014 basically, an equation that explains how neurons communicate with each other via electrical signals.\r\n\r\nThey cracked that problem a few years ago, and this week, their startup, Liquid AI, announced it had used the algorithm to build a new AI platform \u2014 one that requires far less energy than traditional LLMs. The Boston-based firm just got $37.5M in seed funding, with backing from a Boston Celtics co-owner, plus execs at RedHat and Shopify.\r\n\r\n**How it works:\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* Models like GPT and Claude draw from massive, billion-parameter datasets to generate their answers\r\n\r\n* But their digital brains are already at max capacity, so if you feed them new information, they won\u2019t be able to remember it for long\r\n\r\n* On the other hand, Liquid\u2019s model only has a few dozen neurons, but it learns as it goes, piecing together new information alongside the things it already knows\r\n\r\n**Digging Deeper: **The model comes in three different sizes \u2014 1B, 3B, and 40B. They all show state-of-the-art performance and efficiency as well as lower hallucination rates, even while using a completely unique architecture.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **As the name suggests, it\u2019s designed to be more flexible and adaptable \u2014 leading to AI systems that can quickly learn new tasks. Imagine a self-driving car that gets smarter with every mile, continuously refining its skills on the road. Plus, it\u2019s much greener, since less computing power means a smaller carbon footprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **SPONSORED BY MASTERWORKS**\r\n\r\n## **OpenAI = S&P 500?

Then, news that it was adopting a for-profit model \u2014 and that three execs were headed for the door \u2014 sent it crashing back down to earth.\r\n\r\nBut the Sam Altman-led startup just found a [new ladder](https://openai.com/index/scale-the-benefits-of-ai/) right back to the top with a $6.6B funding round that values the company at $157B \u2014 the largest VC deal ever recorded. **Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the historic milestone:**\r\n\r\n* The investment firm Thrive Capital led the round; Microsoft and Nvidia joined in as well \u2014 but Apple was notably absent\r\n\r\n* In an unusual move, the funders promised not to back OpenAI\u2019s biggest rivals, including Anthropic and xAI\r\n\r\n* The company has grown to around 1,700 employees \u2014 up from 700 at the start of 2024\r\n\r\n* Despite some internal chaos, just 6% of employees have left for other firms, according to [Sherwood News](https://sherwood.news/tech/openais-leadership-is-in-upheaval-but-overall-turnover-is-shockingly-low/)\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **Investors are putting a lot of faith in the ChatGPT-maker. It\u2019s now valued at around 40 times its revenue, a ratio way above the norm. Sure, they think it has plenty of room to grow, but the move also signals their confidence that OpenAI is the company best positioned to reach AGI.\r\n\r\n**What will OpenAI do with the funds? **In all likelihood, it\u2019s already deep into building GPT-5. The funding boost will let OpenAI push on to the next level, including models that can interact with the real world, completing complex tasks for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY WEBAI**\r\n\r\n## One Platform.

Sure, having all that knowledge at our fingertips is great \u2014 but the real trick is figuring out how to keep it all straight.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlphabet\u2019s tackling the problem with an experimental platform called [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) designed to be a study buddy, a productivity coach, a veteran librarian, and your favorite podcast host all wrapped into one. Think of it like a souped-up version of Docs that uses AI to help you make sense of videos, research, and meeting notes.\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s it for?\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* **Organizing: **Transform cluttered notes into different formats, including timelines, study guides, and FAQs\r\n\r\n* **Curating: **Pull out only the most relevant information from your notes so you don\u2019t waste time digging through unnecessary details\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s clearly a handy tool for students and academics, but it\u2019s also a great for professionals who want to manage projects and brainstorm ideas.\r\n\r\n**It just got a major overhaul: **Earlier this month, Alphabet introduced an \u201caudio overview\u201d feature that lets you instantly turn any document into a podcast featuring two AI-generated hosts. Now, you can do the same with videos and audio \u2014 then share it with colleagues or classmates via a link.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **By leveraging AI to organize, curate, and even vocalize information, NotebookLM could revolutionize how we learn and work \u2014 making complex data more accessible and actionable for everyone from students to professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY DIGITALOCEAN**\r\n\r\n## **Unlock AI\u2019s full potential with DigitalOcean GPUs**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5c984284-8844-4460-97c5-f080245f1460/digitalocean0927.jpg?t=1727364222)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product) provides **scalable, affordable GPU solutions** that are powerful _and_ user-friendly.\r\n\r\n* Ideal for deep learning, high-performance computing, analytics, and video rendering\r\n\r\n* **Powered by NVIDIA's H100 GPUs**\r\n\r\n* Scales to your business needs to keep costs to a minimum\r\n\r\n* Superb customer service for fast enactment\r\n\r\n**[Be one of the first to try DigitalOcean\u2019s GPU Droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product)****.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **THE AI ACADEMY **\r\n\r\n## How to create interactive data dashboards with Claude\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/b9389faf-92a0-4f2d-ba85-9790481201ff/Group_1000004059__1___1_.jpg?t=1727367367)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlUzali974)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nData dashboards are a great way to visualize and understand data.

[Here\u2019s how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlUzali974):\r\n\r\n1. Go to Claude\u2019s [website](https://claude.ai/new) and sign up. Make sure you select Claude 3.5 Sonnet as your model and turn on the artifact feature.\r\n\r\n2. Attach your CSV file and enter the prompt:\r\n\r\n\"Create an interactive dashboard from this data.\"\r\n\r\n3. Wait for Claude to process your data and generate the dashboard.\r\n\r\n**Pro tips:**\r\n\r\n* You can customize your dashboard by adding or removing charts, changing the colors, and adding filters.\r\n\r\n* You can also export your dashboard as an image or HTML file. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **FROM THE FRONTIER**\r\n\r\n## **What\u2019s next for OpenAI?**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ab854f30-2feb-4841-92e7-163b25556219/download__4___1_.jpg?t=1727381896)\r\nCaption: Source: AP.

In just a few years, HuggingFace has become that toolbox for the AI industry. It\u2019s the go-to place to host your own LLM or borrow ideas from fellow coders \u2014 and it just earned the distinction of being [home](https://x.com/ClementDelangue/status/1839375655688884305) to 1 million models.\r\n\r\n**How it happened: **When it launched in 2016, HuggingFace aimed to build a chatbot geared toward teenagers. But soon, the company realized there was a much bigger opportunity hiding right under its nose. It pivoted to building an AI library that anyone can contribute to, democratizing access to the most powerful open-source models. \r\n\r\n**How it became so popular: **\r\n\r\n* HuggingFace started out as a place for niche developers\r\n\r\n* But it\u2019s steadily brought more people into the fold with an easy-to-use interface, tutorials, and forums\r\n\r\n* From hobbyist developers to tech giants, HuggingFace says everyone is represented in its growing digital neighborhood \u2014 even beginners who don\u2019t have a lot of coding experience\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s inside the library? **The headline-grabbing models like Llama, Mistral, Flux, and Grok are all there, but so are thousands of specialty ones geared toward real-world applications like audio classification, image generation, and everything in between.\r\n\r\n**Why it\u2019s important: **The future of AI isn\u2019t just about creating powerful models, but about making them available and understandable to all who want to use and improve them. That collaborative approach has been so successful that open models \u2014 most recently, the Allen Institute for AI\u2019s fully multimodal Molmo \u2014 can now go toe-to-toe with the likes of GPT-4o and Claude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **A MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSORS**\r\n\r\n## **Only days left: Learn how to scale your startup\u2019s AI potential**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0651c6bf-b5cd-4b2e-a9c3-06abce0f120b/google0930.jpg?t=1727447052)\r\nFollow image link: (https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nWant to enhance your startup with the latest AI solutions, but not sure how?\r\n\r\nAt the [Cloud Startup Summit](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24) on October 8, industry experts and top venture capitalists will teach you\u2026\r\n\r\n* **How to harness AI breakthroughs in your business**\r\n\r\n* Venture capital and funding trends\r\n\r\n* How other startups are disrupting with AI\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll also have time to network with VCs and founders and explore more support options for your startup.\r\n\r\n**[RSVP for the October 8 summit here](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)****.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **THE AI ACADEMY **\r\n\r\n## **Virtually try on clothes with HuggingFace**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/80338764-2667-44cd-a2fd-68838b567f06/Group_1000004121.jpg?t=1727453125)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nYou can try on clothes virtually with HuggingFace's Kolors Virtual Try-On tool.

The chip designer went on an acquisition [frenzy](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-acquires-octoai-2024-9) this year, gobbling up five companies so far. Its latest purchase: OctoAI, a five-year-old startup that helps companies tweak their hardware so it's more customizable. It reportedly paid around $165M for the Seattle-based company.\r\n\r\n**What does Nvidia get out of it? **The world\u2019s third-largest company creates the most powerful AI chips around, but they\u2019re only compatible with Nvidia\u2019s own hardware, making them less friendly to industry newcomers. OctoAI\u2019s software acts as a translator, helping Nvidia chips work with any type of infrastructure \u2014 a move that\u2019s more accessible for smaller developers.\r\n\r\nIn general, the string of purchases shows that Nvidia wants to expand its horizons beyond GPUs. It makes sense from a talent perspective, too: Bringing on a team of highly skilled developers is much easier than recruiting each member individually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY INNOVATING WITH AI**\r\n\r\n## Want to become an AI Consultant?\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/655956dc-3643-4084-9281-08bb970dd0a4/IWAI_Consultancy_E.jpg?t=1727447115)\r\nFollow image link: (https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nInnovating with AI just welcomed 200 new students into [The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman), their new program that trains you to build a business as an AI consultant:\r\n\r\n* Tools, frameworks, and a 6-month plan to build a 6-figure AI consulting business\r\n\r\n**[Click here to request early access to The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **AI & TECH NEWS**\r\n\r\n## Everything else you need to know today\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/66890527-b9f6-4573-bad0-db517cad3f9c/1727277123660.jpg?t=1727460344)\r\nCaption: Source: Meta\r\n\r\n* **Uncanny Update:** Meta users may soon notice personalized, AI-generated posts appearing on their timelines, including images that feature their own likeness.\r\n\r\n* **Stay the Course: **OpenAI\u2019s CFO reportedly told employees the startup is moving forward with plans to close a funding round next week, despite a series of high-profile resignations.\r\n\r\n* **Per My Last Email: **Gemini\u2019s smart replies feature can now analyze full email threads in order to generate responses that \u201cfully capture the intent of your message.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udde0 **Brain Food: **According to a new Cambridge study, AI might have CEOs beat when it comes to things like market optimization and product design.

To do it, they first had to solve a calculus puzzle that has eluded mathematicians since 1907 \u2014 basically, an equation that explains how neurons communicate with each other via electrical signals.\r\n\r\nThey cracked that problem a few years ago, and this week, their startup, Liquid AI, announced it had used the algorithm to build a new AI platform \u2014 one that requires far less energy than traditional LLMs. The Boston-based firm just got $37.5M in seed funding, with backing from a Boston Celtics co-owner, plus execs at RedHat and Shopify.\r\n\r\n**How it works:\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* Models like GPT and Claude draw from massive, billion-parameter datasets to generate their answers\r\n\r\n* But their digital brains are already at max capacity, so if you feed them new information, they won\u2019t be able to remember it for long\r\n\r\n* On the other hand, Liquid\u2019s model only has a few dozen neurons, but it learns as it goes, piecing together new information alongside the things it already knows\r\n\r\n**Digging Deeper: **The model comes in three different sizes \u2014 1B, 3B, and 40B. They all show state-of-the-art performance and efficiency as well as lower hallucination rates, even while using a completely unique architecture.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **As the name suggests, it\u2019s designed to be more flexible and adaptable \u2014 leading to AI systems that can quickly learn new tasks. Imagine a self-driving car that gets smarter with every mile, continuously refining its skills on the road. Plus, it\u2019s much greener, since less computing power means a smaller carbon footprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **SPONSORED BY MASTERWORKS**\r\n\r\n## **OpenAI = S&P 500?

But at a preview event Tuesday, Microsoft\u2019s Mustafa Suleyman said he thinks AI will make our devices more malleable, like clay that can be shaped and molded. With that in mind, Microsoft just unveiled a set of brand-new Copilot features. Here\u2019s everything we saw at Tuesday\u2019s sneak peek.\r\n\r\n**Copilot Voice: **An answer to OpenAI\u2019s Advanced Voice mode with a special focus on emotional intelligence. Its four voices can match your mood, make self-deprecating jokes, and reassure you if you\u2019re having a rough day.\r\n\r\n**Copilot Vision: **This feature can see everything on your screen and react accordingly. In one demo, a user asked about movies on Rotten Tomatoes. Copilot told him which ones were available to stream, offered review summaries, and gave custom recommendations.\r\n\r\n**Recall: **A super-powered browsing history that can help you find long-lost webpages and documents (i.e. \u201cFind the chart with the purple arrow from last week\u201d). It now includes biometric safety features and encryption.\r\n\r\n**What else?**\r\n\r\n* **Think Deeper**, powered by a fine-tuned version of o1, will help with complex decisions, like planning a family vacation\r\n\r\n* **Copilot Daily** is an AI-generated daily podcast with news stories tailored to you\r\n\r\n* **Paint** will automatically turn your scribbles into detailed works of art\r\n\r\n* **AI Search** helps you intuitively find settings, files, images, and more\r\n\r\n**Next up**, Suleyman wants to give Copilot a higher \u201caction quotient\u201d \u2014 or the ability to proactively reach out to you and make calls or purchases on your behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY AE STUDIO**\r\n\r\n## From idea to million-user experience\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/8dd5375c-7e00-42f8-b94d-35f99cb99bbe/aestudio1002.jpg?t=1727793390)\r\nFollow image link: (https://ae.studio/?utm_campaign=superhuman-100224&utm_source=superhuman&utm_medium=newsletter)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**Millions of users**, one live event, and an app that just... works.\r\n\r\nThat's what AE Studio pulled off for Eurovision Latinoam\u00e9rica.

It\u2019s now valued at around 40 times its revenue, a ratio way above the norm. Sure, they think it has plenty of room to grow, but the move also signals their confidence that OpenAI is the company best positioned to reach AGI.\r\n\r\n**What will OpenAI do with the funds? **In all likelihood, it\u2019s already deep into building GPT-5.

Sure, having all that knowledge at our fingertips is great \u2014 but the real trick is figuring out how to keep it all straight.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlphabet\u2019s tackling the problem with an experimental platform called [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) designed to be a study buddy, a productivity coach, a veteran librarian, and your favorite podcast host all wrapped into one. Think of it like a souped-up version of Docs that uses AI to help you make sense of videos, research, and meeting notes.\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s it for?\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* **Organizing: **Transform cluttered notes into different formats, including timelines, study guides, and FAQs\r\n\r\n* **Curating: **Pull out only the most relevant information from your notes so you don\u2019t waste time digging through unnecessary details\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s clearly a handy tool for students and academics, but it\u2019s also a great for professionals who want to manage projects and brainstorm ideas.\r\n\r\n**It just got a major overhaul: **Earlier this month, Alphabet introduced an \u201caudio overview\u201d feature that lets you instantly turn any document into a podcast featuring two AI-generated hosts. Now, you can do the same with videos and audio \u2014 then share it with colleagues or classmates via a link.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **By leveraging AI to organize, curate, and even vocalize information, NotebookLM could revolutionize how we learn and work \u2014 making complex data more accessible and actionable for everyone from students to professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY DIGITALOCEAN**\r\n\r\n## **Unlock AI\u2019s full potential with DigitalOcean GPUs**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5c984284-8844-4460-97c5-f080245f1460/digitalocean0927.jpg?t=1727364222)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product) provides **scalable, affordable GPU solutions** that are powerful _and_ user-friendly.\r\n\r\n* Ideal for deep learning, high-performance computing, analytics, and video rendering\r\n\r\n* **Powered by NVIDIA's H100 GPUs**\r\n\r\n* Scales to your business needs to keep costs to a minimum\r\n\r\n* Superb customer service for fast enactment\r\n\r\n**[Be one of the first to try DigitalOcean\u2019s GPU Droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman&utm_campaign=global_gpu_aiml_en&utm_content=product)****.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **THE AI ACADEMY **\r\n\r\n## How to create interactive data dashboards with Claude\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/b9389faf-92a0-4f2d-ba85-9790481201ff/Group_1000004059__1___1_.jpg?t=1727367367)\r\nFollow image link: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlUzali974)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nData dashboards are a great way to visualize and understand data.

[Here\u2019s how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlUzali974):\r\n\r\n1. Go to Claude\u2019s [website](https://claude.ai/new) and sign up. Make sure you select Claude 3.5 Sonnet as your model and turn on the artifact feature.\r\n\r\n2. Attach your CSV file and enter the prompt:\r\n\r\n\"Create an interactive dashboard from this data.\"\r\n\r\n3. Wait for Claude to process your data and generate the dashboard.\r\n\r\n**Pro tips:**\r\n\r\n* You can customize your dashboard by adding or removing charts, changing the colors, and adding filters.\r\n\r\n* You can also export your dashboard as an image or HTML file. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **FROM THE FRONTIER**\r\n\r\n## **What\u2019s next for OpenAI?**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ab854f30-2feb-4841-92e7-163b25556219/download__4___1_.jpg?t=1727381896)\r\nCaption: Source: AP.

To do it, they first had to solve a calculus puzzle that has eluded mathematicians since 1907 \u2014 basically, an equation that explains how neurons communicate with each other via electrical signals.\r\n\r\nThey cracked that problem a few years ago, and this week, their startup, Liquid AI, announced it had used the algorithm to build a new AI platform \u2014 one that requires far less energy than traditional LLMs. The Boston-based firm just got $37.5M in seed funding, with backing from a Boston Celtics co-owner, plus execs at RedHat and Shopify.\r\n\r\n**How it works:\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* Models like GPT and Claude draw from massive, billion-parameter datasets to generate their answers\r\n\r\n* But their digital brains are already at max capacity, so if you feed them new information, they won\u2019t be able to remember it for long\r\n\r\n* On the other hand, Liquid\u2019s model only has a few dozen neurons, but it learns as it goes, piecing together new information alongside the things it already knows\r\n\r\n**Digging Deeper: **The model comes in three different sizes \u2014 1B, 3B, and 40B. They all show state-of-the-art performance and efficiency as well as lower hallucination rates, even while using a completely unique architecture.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **As the name suggests, it\u2019s designed to be more flexible and adaptable \u2014 leading to AI systems that can quickly learn new tasks. Imagine a self-driving car that gets smarter with every mile, continuously refining its skills on the road. Plus, it\u2019s much greener, since less computing power means a smaller carbon footprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **SPONSORED BY MASTERWORKS**\r\n\r\n## **OpenAI = S&P 500?

It shot to new heights with the reasoning-focused o1 and the long-awaited Advanced Voice mode.

It\u2019s now valued at around 40 times its revenue, a ratio way above the norm. Sure, they think it has plenty of room to grow, but the move also signals their confidence that OpenAI is the company best positioned to reach AGI.\r\n\r\n**What will OpenAI do with the funds? **In all likelihood, it\u2019s already deep into building GPT-5.

In just a few years, HuggingFace has become that toolbox for the AI industry. It\u2019s the go-to place to host your own LLM or borrow ideas from fellow coders \u2014 and it just earned the distinction of being [home](https://x.com/ClementDelangue/status/1839375655688884305) to 1 million models.\r\n\r\n**How it happened: **When it launched in 2016, HuggingFace aimed to build a chatbot geared toward teenagers. But soon, the company realized there was a much bigger opportunity hiding right under its nose. It pivoted to building an AI library that anyone can contribute to, democratizing access to the most powerful open-source models. \r\n\r\n**How it became so popular: **\r\n\r\n* HuggingFace started out as a place for niche developers\r\n\r\n* But it\u2019s steadily brought more people into the fold with an easy-to-use interface, tutorials, and forums\r\n\r\n* From hobbyist developers to tech giants, HuggingFace says everyone is represented in its growing digital neighborhood \u2014 even beginners who don\u2019t have a lot of coding experience\r\n\r\n**What\u2019s inside the library? **The headline-grabbing models like Llama, Mistral, Flux, and Grok are all there, but so are thousands of specialty ones geared toward real-world applications like audio classification, image generation, and everything in between.\r\n\r\n**Why it\u2019s important: **The future of AI isn\u2019t just about creating powerful models, but about making them available and understandable to all who want to use and improve them. That collaborative approach has been so successful that open models \u2014 most recently, the Allen Institute for AI\u2019s fully multimodal Molmo \u2014 can now go toe-to-toe with the likes of GPT-4o and Claude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **A MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSORS**\r\n\r\n## **Only days left: Learn how to scale your startup\u2019s AI potential**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0651c6bf-b5cd-4b2e-a9c3-06abce0f120b/google0930.jpg?t=1727447052)\r\nFollow image link: (https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nWant to enhance your startup with the latest AI solutions, but not sure how?\r\n\r\nAt the [Cloud Startup Summit](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24) on October 8, industry experts and top venture capitalists will teach you\u2026\r\n\r\n* **How to harness AI breakthroughs in your business**\r\n\r\n* Venture capital and funding trends\r\n\r\n* How other startups are disrupting with AI\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll also have time to network with VCs and founders and explore more support options for your startup.\r\n\r\n**[RSVP for the October 8 summit here](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/summit-startup-24)****.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **THE AI ACADEMY **\r\n\r\n## **Virtually try on clothes with HuggingFace**\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/80338764-2667-44cd-a2fd-68838b567f06/Group_1000004121.jpg?t=1727453125)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nYou can try on clothes virtually with HuggingFace's Kolors Virtual Try-On tool.

The chip designer went on an acquisition [frenzy](https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-acquires-octoai-2024-9) this year, gobbling up five companies so far. Its latest purchase: OctoAI, a five-year-old startup that helps companies tweak their hardware so it's more customizable. It reportedly paid around $165M for the Seattle-based company.\r\n\r\n**What does Nvidia get out of it? **The world\u2019s third-largest company creates the most powerful AI chips around, but they\u2019re only compatible with Nvidia\u2019s own hardware, making them less friendly to industry newcomers. OctoAI\u2019s software acts as a translator, helping Nvidia chips work with any type of infrastructure \u2014 a move that\u2019s more accessible for smaller developers.\r\n\r\nIn general, the string of purchases shows that Nvidia wants to expand its horizons beyond GPUs. It makes sense from a talent perspective, too: Bringing on a team of highly skilled developers is much easier than recruiting each member individually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **PRESENTED BY INNOVATING WITH AI**\r\n\r\n## Want to become an AI Consultant?\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/655956dc-3643-4084-9281-08bb970dd0a4/IWAI_Consultancy_E.jpg?t=1727447115)\r\nFollow image link: (https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\nInnovating with AI just welcomed 200 new students into [The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman), their new program that trains you to build a business as an AI consultant:\r\n\r\n* Tools, frameworks, and a 6-month plan to build a 6-figure AI consulting business\r\n\r\n**[Click here to request early access to The AI Consultancy Project](https://go.innovatingwithai.com/consultancy-superhuman)**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **AI & TECH NEWS**\r\n\r\n## Everything else you need to know today\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/66890527-b9f6-4573-bad0-db517cad3f9c/1727277123660.jpg?t=1727460344)\r\nCaption: Source: Meta\r\n\r\n* **Uncanny Update:** Meta users may soon notice personalized, AI-generated posts appearing on their timelines, including images that feature their own likeness.\r\n\r\n* **Stay the Course: **OpenAI\u2019s CFO reportedly told employees the startup is moving forward with plans to close a funding round next week, despite a series of high-profile resignations.\r\n\r\n* **Per My Last Email: **Gemini\u2019s smart replies feature can now analyze full email threads in order to generate responses that \u201cfully capture the intent of your message.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udde0 **Brain Food: **According to a new Cambridge study, AI might have CEOs beat when it comes to things like market optimization and product design.

To do it, they first had to solve a calculus puzzle that has eluded mathematicians since 1907 \u2014 basically, an equation that explains how neurons communicate with each other via electrical signals.\r\n\r\nThey cracked that problem a few years ago, and this week, their startup, Liquid AI, announced it had used the algorithm to build a new AI platform \u2014 one that requires far less energy than traditional LLMs. The Boston-based firm just got $37.5M in seed funding, with backing from a Boston Celtics co-owner, plus execs at RedHat and Shopify.\r\n\r\n**How it works:\u00a0**\r\n\r\n* Models like GPT and Claude draw from massive, billion-parameter datasets to generate their answers\r\n\r\n* But their digital brains are already at max capacity, so if you feed them new information, they won\u2019t be able to remember it for long\r\n\r\n* On the other hand, Liquid\u2019s model only has a few dozen neurons, but it learns as it goes, piecing together new information alongside the things it already knows\r\n\r\n**Digging Deeper: **The model comes in three different sizes \u2014 1B, 3B, and 40B. They all show state-of-the-art performance and efficiency as well as lower hallucination rates, even while using a completely unique architecture.\r\n\r\n**Why it matters: **As the name suggests, it\u2019s designed to be more flexible and adaptable \u2014 leading to AI systems that can quickly learn new tasks. Imagine a self-driving car that gets smarter with every mile, continuously refining its skills on the road. Plus, it\u2019s much greener, since less computing power means a smaller carbon footprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n##### **SPONSORED BY MASTERWORKS**\r\n\r\n## **OpenAI = S&P 500?

Whether it's turning blog posts into podcasts or dubbing videos into multiple languages, AI-generated audio opens up new possibilities for creators and businesses alike.\r\n\r\n#### Step 1. Setup an Eleven Labs account\r\n\r\nEleven Labs has a suite of audio and speech features that you can use. All the features in this tutorial are available to try for free.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, you can create an mp3 file of a speaker reading out your content using the \u201ctext-to-speech\u201d tab.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/9551ad0f-66f3-4cfd-a629-bfdb28d505e2/image.png?t=1727950556)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n#### Step 2. Create more rich audio content\r\n\r\n* For the \u201cSound Effects\u201d, you can use a descriptive prompt for the effects you need. Adjust the \u201cPrompt Influence\u201d slider to control the AI's creativity.\r\n\r\n* On clicking \u201cGenerate sound effects\u201d, you can choose and download from the four variations provided.\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/691aa742-bc9b-4b0e-a3b5-01a513dc2ac8/image.png?t=1727951884)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n* To translate content, use the \u201cDubbing\u201d tab and select your source and target languages.\r\n\r\n* Upload your audio or video file or provide a link to it.\r\n\r\n* Adjust the settings (Number of Speakers, Video Resolution, Time Range, Watermark).\r\n\r\n* Create, view and download your dubbed audio or video.\r\n\r\n**Tip: **You can use ChatGPT to rewrite your content like a podcast before uploading it to ElevenLabs to get rid of the monotonous reading and get engaging audio (like NotebookLM\u2019s Audio Overviews).\r\n\r\n_This walkthrough is a condensed version of _[_this tutorial_](https://bensbites.com/tutorial/add-ai-generated-audio-to-your-projects/?utm_content=snack-n-skill)_.
